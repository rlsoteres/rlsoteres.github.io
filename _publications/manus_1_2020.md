We present a detailed snow avalanche susceptibility map at scale 1:20,000 of the Circo de
Gredos in the Sierra de Gredos (Iberian Central System, Spain). This cirque-shaped landscape
is one of the most popular spots for winter sports in the region. However, no snow
avalanche activity assessment has been conducted to date. We have, therefore, produced a
snow avalanche susceptibility map based on aerial and satellite imagery, newspaper reviews
and field work, including avalanche features recognition and interviews with frequent
backcountry users. We extracted the spatial distribution of necessary and enhancer factors
for triggering slab, wet and loose snow avalanches from a digital elevation model. Finally,
calculations to evaluate each snow avalanche type susceptibility were performed using a
Geographical Information System. By combining our map collection, we concluded that most
of the area in the Circo de Gredos is highly susceptible to snow avalanches, especially slab
and wet snow types.
