We present a geomorphic map of the glacial landforms associated with the Golfo Corcovado
ice lobe in northwestern Patagonia. Built upon prior studies, our map elaborates on the central
and southern sectors of Isla Grande de Chiloé and neighboring islands. Through a combination
of remote sensing techniques and exhaustive fieldwork, we identified a suite of ice-marginal,
subglacial, and glaciofluvial features created by the Golfo Corcovado ice lobe during four
maxima within the last glacial cycle, in none of which the ice-front reached the Pacific coast
of Isla Grande de Chiloé. Our mapping builds a foundation and provides insights for future
interdisciplinary research on the Late Quaternary sequence of glacial and paleoclimatic
events in this key sector of northwestern Patagonia.
