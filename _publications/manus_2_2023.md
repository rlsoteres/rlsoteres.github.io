Muir, R., Eaves, S., Vargo, L., Anderson, B., Mackintosh, A., Sagredo, E., **Soteres, R. L.** “Late glacial climate evolution in the Patagonian Andes (44-47° S) from alpine glacier modelling”. Quaternary Science Reviews, 305, 108035. 

Numerical glacier models applied to moraine chronologies provide an opportunity to quantify past
climate change. Here we apply a two-dimensional coupled mass balance e ice flow model to well-dated
moraine sequences deposited by former alpine glaciers at two central Patagonian sites: Cerro Riñon
(43.97S, 71.64W) and Río Tranquilo (47.50S, 72.38W), to reconstruct the local temperatures during
both the Antarctic Cold Reversal (14.7-13 ka) and the Younger Dryas (12.9-11 ka). Modelled temperature
anomalies during the Antarctic Cold Reversal are 2.6 ± 0.4 C at 44S, and 2.9 ± 0.6 C at 47S. At
both locations this cold event is followed by temperature increases of þ0.6e0.7 C or precipitation reductions
of c. 20% to drive glacier retreat to moraines deposited during Younger Dryas time. The
consistent climatic anomalies between these two latitudes suggest this region of Patagonia was
responding to a common climatic event. Further, the late-glacial temperature anomalies found here
compare well to those determined by similar glacier modelling techniques in New Zealand, at 43-44 S.
These results support a trans-Pacific response throughout the southern mid to high latitudes (43-47 S)
during the ACR that is best explained by a northward expansion of the south westerly winds.
