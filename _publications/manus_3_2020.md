We present a geomorphic map of the landforms created by the Patagonian Ice Sheet during the
local Last Glacial Maximum and perhaps prior glaciations in southernmost Patagonia. Building
on prior work, the new mapping focuses in unprecedented detail on the right lateral and frontal
landforms formed by the Strait of Magellan ice lobe. We produced the map using aerial
orthophotography, Sentinel-2 and SPOT satellite imagery, ALOS PALSAR digital elevation
model and fieldwork to ground-truth preliminary interpretations. We delineate at least five
glacial events defined by a sequence of moraine drifts and associated glaciofluvial features.
In contrast to previous studies, we propose the Magellan ice lobe extended ∼65 km farther,
to the Primera Angostura peninsula, during the local Last Glacial Maximum. Our study
provides a new context to establish a precise glacial chronology of the Magellan ice lobe
during the last glacial cycle in the middle-high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.
