We present a detailed geomorphological map of the landform assemblages originated by the two
major paleoglaciers of the Sierra de Gredos mountain range in the Spanish Iberian Central System.
Based on previous works, our map focused on the features formed by Gredos and Pinar
paleoglaciers during the last glaciation and subsequent glacial events. Based on a remote
sensing analysis and exhaustive field surveys, we identified with great accuracy the local
distribution of glacial, periglacial, mass movement, structural, fluvial, and lacustrine features. We
recognized three main glacial geomorphological formations representing: (i) the maximum
glacial extension reached (peripheral deposits); (ii) the culmination of glacial conditions
(principal moraines) and (iii) the local glacial withdrawal (internal deposits). Our map offers a
renewed spatial framework on which to conduct higher-resolution glacial chronologies,
especially of Late Glacial and Holocene glacial activity, providing key information for performing
future paleoclimatic reconstructions of the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes.
