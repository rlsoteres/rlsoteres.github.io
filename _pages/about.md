Hi all!
This is Rodrigo L. Soteres a half Spaniard, half Chilean geomorphologist currently based at the Centro de Investigación GAIA-Antártica [(CIGA)](http://www.umag.cl/gaiaantartica/) of the Universidad de Magallanes in Punta Arenas (Chile). For the past 10 years, I have been studiying how Patagonian glaciers behave during past glaciation by analyzing landscape features and dating them through cosmogenic nuclides.
