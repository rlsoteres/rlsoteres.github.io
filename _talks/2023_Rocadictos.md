For some beautiful reason, in Chile, we have an Earth Sciences show on national radio called [**Rocadictos**](https://www.instagram.com/rocadictos_uchile/?hl=es). It is hosted by young geology professors, students, and journalists from the Universidad de Chile, and they interview geoscientists focused on a variety of topics from all around the country. In 2023, I was lucky enough to be invited to talk about glaciers and glaciations in Patagonia and to listen to some Beastie Boys songs. It was a lot of fun, and I got to present the amazing drumlin field near Punta Arenas to the whole country!

Hope you enjoy it!
