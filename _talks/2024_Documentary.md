In the past few years, I have had the chance to participate in the Patagonia Icefield Research Program (PIRP) as faculty in glacial geology. This awesome iniatiative was created by Camilo Rada and Natalia Martínez, two of the greatest explorers of Patagonia, as terrain course of the Glaciology Master of the [Centro de Investigación GAIA-Antártica (CIGA)](https://glacio.umag.cl/). In 2023, we were got some additional funds by the [International Glaciological Society (IGS)](https://www.igsoc.org/) and the [International Association of Cryospheric Sciences (IACS)](https://cryosphericsciences.org/), so we went international for the first time, welcoming students and faculty from Argentina, Chile, United States and Switzerland. 

You can check our expedition to the glaciar Grey in the Parque Nacional Torres del Paine (Región de Magallanes, Chile) in **Grey: El Camino del Hielo**. The documentary has 5 episodes (here just the first one) and was filmed by Gastón Peralta from UMAGtv. 

Hope you enjoy it!
