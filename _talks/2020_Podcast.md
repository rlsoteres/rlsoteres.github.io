I have been collaborating with [**Fundación Glaciares Chilenos**](https://www.glaciareschilenos.org/) since 2020. This Chilean NGO advocates for protecting Andean glaciers through education and political action. Thanks to them, I had the opportunity of participating in a podcast series from Spain focused on "water" named [**Planeta Agua**](https://www.podcastidae.com/podcast/planeta-agua/) hosted by Natalia Pérez Valle. This time we talked about frozen water.
It was my first time on a podcast, but was very fun!

Hope you enjoy the conversation!
