This book is one of the things that makes me proudest of my years as a scientist. Isla Grande de Chiloé is a well-known Chilean island in northern Patagonia. It is definitively a magical place whose people still guards the local mithology and culture alive. I spent several years working on the glacial geomorphology of the island as part of my Ph.D. dissertation, so I have a **love**-hate relationship with Chiloé. Local sibilings geologists from Achao, Melissa y Guido González-Subiabre, put together a beatiful project to compile a book for kids focused on the geological history of the Chilotan Archipelago called [**¿Cómo se formó Chiloé? En busca de la historia geológica de la isla**](https://indd.adobe.com/view/93ae73ec-3500-4602-9c5e-d7fce8dc2203). I found the initiative in social media and sent them a message rigth away offering all the knowledge I collected from their islands during my Ph.D. Fortunately, they allowed me to join the team of scientists, teachers and artists who were behind the book!
