This book is one of the things that makes me proudest of my years as a scientist. Isla Grande de Chiloé is a well-known Chilean island in northern Patagonia. It is definitely a magical place whose people still guard the local mythology and culture. I spent several years focused on the glacial geomorphology of the island, working with my research group as part of my Ph.D. dissertation, so I have a **love**-hate relationship with Chiloé. Local sibling geologists from Achao, **Melissa and Guido González-Subiabre**, put together a beautiful project to create a children’s book on the geological history of the Chilotan Archipelago called [**¿Cómo se formó Chiloé? En busca de la historia geológica de la isla**](https://indd.adobe.com/view/93ae73ec-3500-4602-9c5e-d7fce8dc2203). I found the initiative on social media and immediately sent them a message, offering all the knowledge I had collected from their islands during my research. Fortunately, they allowed me to join the team of scientists, teachers, and artists behind the book!
