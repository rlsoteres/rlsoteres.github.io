In the past few years, I have had the chance to participate in the Patagonia Icefield Research Program (PIRP) as faculty in glacial geology. This awesome iniatiative was created by Camilo Rada and Natalia Martínez, two of the greatest explorers of Patagonia, as a fieldwork-oriented course for the [Glaciology Master](https://glacio.umag.cl/) of the Centro de Investigación GAIA-Antártica [(CIGA)](http://www.umag.cl/gaiaantartica/). In 2023, we got some additional funds by the International Glaciological Society (IGS) and the International Association of Cryospheric Sciences (IACS), so we went international for the first time, welcoming students and faculty from Argentina, Chile, United States and Switzerland.

The program has three pillars, education, research and community. So, during two weeks the students will learn fundamentals of glacier transit safety, photogrametry, geophysics, mass balance meassurements, glacial hydrology and glacial geomorphology.
