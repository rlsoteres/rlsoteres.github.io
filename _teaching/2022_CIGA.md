Since 2022, I have been teaching Glacial Geology in the [Glaciology Master](https://glacio.umag.cl/) of the [Centro de Investigación Gaia-Antártica](http://www.umag.cl/gaiaantartica/).

The course main goal is for the students to learn how to recognize glacial features, analyze their principal sedimentary components an structures and, finally, to conduct geomorphic-based ELA reconstruction.
